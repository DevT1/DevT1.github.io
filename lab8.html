    <h1>Lab 8: Stunts!</h1>
    
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of Lab 8 is to be able to conduct one of two stunt. The two stunts we can choose from is a drift of about 3 ft from a wall or object or a flip from that same distance. This lab combines the Kalman filter made in lab 7, the PID controller from lab 5, and the motor design from lab 4 and the TOF sensors from lab 3 to allow our robot to conduct a basic stunt. The stunt I decided to work on was the Drift.</p>
    
    <h2>Parts Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 x Fully assembled robot with Artemis, ToF sensors, and an IMU.</li>
        <li>Crash-pillows mounted along the wall for protection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When practicing at home, used pillows, empty bookbadgs, and other soft objects to ensure safety of the robot.</p>
    
    <h2>Lab Procedure</h2>
    
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>My code for this lab is relaively simple compared to the expectation of using the Kalman filter from lab 7. 
      I tried to use my Kalman Filter but I was running into major issues and bugs that I did not iron out in the pervious lab so I opted to use linear extrapolation as its subsitute.
      It was a simple section of code that kept track of velocity and a predicted distance as seen in this code snippet:</p>
      <pre>
        int velocity = currentDistance - lastDistance;
        int predictedDistance = currentDistance + velocity;
      </pre>
      <p>Thus in turn lead to me using:</p>
      <pre>
        if(predictedDistance <= 300){
              Serial.println(" Entered drift seq");
              analogWrite(MotorPin1, 250);
              analogWrite(MotorPin2, 0);
              analogWrite(MotorPin3, 0);
              analogWrite(MotorPin4, 255);
              delay(250);

              
              analogWrite(MotorPin1, 0);
              analogWrite(MotorPin2, 0);
              analogWrite(MotorPin3, 0);
              analogWrite(MotorPin4, 0);
              
            } else{
              Serial.println(" Entered drive straight seq");
              analogWrite(MotorPin1, 80);
              analogWrite(MotorPin2, 0);
              analogWrite(MotorPin3, 75);
              analogWrite(MotorPin4, 0);
            }
      </pre>

    <h3>Drift Trials</h3>
    <p>To arrive to this code I had various runs that were massive failures as seen below:</p>

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    
    <p>In the end I was able to capture a run that although is not perfect shows that the robot can drift and react after an intial drift as seen below:</p>

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
  <p>If interested a graph of this run is shown here:</p>
  <img src="images for website/lab 8/distance_vs_time_graph_for_lab 8.png" alt="ToF Data vs. Time">
  <p>Note: I did not include graphs of the other runs since they were not good enough runs to consitute gathering distance data from them.</p>
   <h3>Imporvements Needed For Future</h3>
      <li>Implemenation of Kalman Filter</li>
      <li>Use PID controller for smoother control of the spin. This could mean using the orientation and braking section to ensure a good breaking distance and to quickly spin around robot for a more effiecnt drift</li>
    </ul>
