    <h1>Lab 7: Kalman Filter</h1>
    
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Due to the robot moving at rates faster than my TOF sensors can gather data I need implemenet something that can predict potential measurements so that my robot can act accordingly. This lead to the implemenataion of a Kalman filter which can gather potential data at a much faster rate than the TOF sensors.</p>
    
    <h2>Parts Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 x Fully assembled robot with Artemis, ToF sensors, and an IMU.</li>
        <li>Crash-pillows mounted along the wall for protection.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Lab Procedure</h2>
    <p>To fully implement the Kalman Filter I needed to be able to find the drag and momentum of my robot.</p>
    <h3>Estimating Drag and Momentum</h3>
    <p>
        To estimate these two I needed to choose a step response around 50% - 100% of the PWM value I used in Lab 5. Thus I choose the PWM value to be 80 which also was the value used in lecture to explain the filter and the process to create one. 
        I then placed my robot 7 ft away from a wall and sent my robot towards said wall so that it gave my robot ample time to get a steady state velocity 
        that can be helpful to implement the filter. After doing this test I was able to gather these graphs that show the PWM value, TOF distance readings, and Velcoity of the robot:

    <p>
        From this I found the steady state portion of my veloctiy graph by running thsi portion of code:
    </p>
    <code>
        # Find indices where PWM == 80 and time > 1000 ms
        steady_indices = [i for i in range(len(time)) if pwm[i] == 80 and time[i] >= 1000]
        
        # Extract corresponding steady-state velocities
        steady_state_portion = [velocity[i] for i in steady_indices]
        
        # Compute average steady-state speed
        if steady_state_portion:
            Average_speed = sum(steady_state_portion) / len(steady_state_portion)
            print("Steady-state speed:", Average_speed)
        else:
            print("No steady-state portion found.")
    </code>
    <p>
        I then used the average_speed from the steady state portion of the velocity graph to find which was 274.94 ms which was around 0.9 seconds. I then throw those values into the drag and momentum formaulas:
        
    </p>
        [INSERT PIC OF d and m formulas]
    <p>
        In the end I found that the drag was 0.0036371321381966503 and the momentum was found to be 0.3908650337129267.
        This then lead me to be able to create my A and B matrcies from lecture:
    </p>
    [INSERT A and B matrices]

    <p>
        Since matrix C was already given with values inside of it I was able to find A and B discretize them create
        a state vector and create noise matrices.
    </p>
    [INSERT code of creation of A, B, state vetcor, and Covariance matrices]
    <ul>
        <li>Build a state-space model by estimating drag and momentum terms for A and B matrices.</li>
        <li>Conduct a step response by driving the robot at a constant motor speed while logging input values and ToF sensor output.</li>
        <li>Choose a step response input (50%-100% of max PWM value).</li>
        <li>Ensure step time is long enough to reach steady state.</li>
        <li>Use a foam piece to prevent damage from collisions.</li>
        <li>Plot and analyze ToF sensor output, speed, and motor input.</li>
        <li>Measure steady-state speed and rise time (60%-90%).</li>
        <li>Save data persistently (CSV, pickle, or shelve file).</li>
    </ul
    
    <h3>2. Implementation of Kalman Filter (Python)</h3>
    <p>
        In the end I used the code from lecture to fully implement a Kalman Filter function to gather
        predicted TOF distance data.
    </p>

    <code>
        def kalman_filter(mu,sigma,u,y):
        mu_p = A.dot(mu) + B.dot(u)
        sigma_p = A.dot(sigma.dot(A.transpose())) + sig_u
        
        sigma_m = C.dot(sigma_p.dot(C.transpose())) + sig_z
        kkf_gain = sigma_p.dot(C.transpose().dot(np.linalg.inv(sigma_m)))
    
        y_m = y - C.dot(mu_p)
        mu = mu_p + kkf_gain.dot(y_m)
        sigma = (np.eye(2) - kkf_gain.dot(C)).dot(sigma_p)
    
        return mu,sigma
    </code>
