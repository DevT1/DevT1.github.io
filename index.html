    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>At the time of the creation of this website I am a Senior studying ECE. Within ECE at Cornell, I am interested in the intersection of embedded system programming and robotics. I am very excited to take this course and learn as much as I can. Also I like listening to music specifically Rap, Neo Soul, and RNB adn currently working on a project dealing with using embedded systems and the natural world.</p>
