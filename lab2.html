    <h1>Lab 2: IMU</h1>
    
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this lab is to integrate an IMU into the robot, transition to battery-powered operation, and record a stunt with the RC robot.</p>
    
    <h2>Parts Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 x SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano</li>
        <li>1 x USB cable</li>
        <li>1 x 9DOF IMU sensor</li>
        <li>1 x Force1 RC car</li>
        <li>1 x Li-Ion 3.7V 850mAh battery</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Setup the IMU</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Install the “SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout_ICM 20948_Arduino Library” from the Arduino Library Manager.</li>
        <li>Connect the IMU to the Artemis board using the QWIIC connectors.</li>
        <li>Run the example program and analyze sensor output.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Accelerometer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I gathered the accelerometer data with pitch and roll using these equations.
            <img src="images for website/lab2/lab2_Pitch_acc_eqs.png" width="650" height="400" alt="Acc Eqs">
        </li>
        
        <li>
            This allowed me to get outputs from -90 to 0 and 0 to 90 degrees for both the pitch and roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll:
             <img src="images for website/lab2/lab2_Roll_0-(-90).png" width="650" height="400" alt="Roll for -90 to 0">
             <img src="images for website/lab2/lab2_Roll_0-(90).png" width="650" height="400" alt="Roll for 0 to 90">
        </li>
        <li>
            Pitch:
             <img src="images for website/lab2/lab2_Pitch_0-(-90).png" width="650" height="400" alt="Pitch for -90 to 0">
             <img src="images for website/lab2/lab2_Pitch_0-(90).png" width="650" height="400" alt="Pitch for 0 to 90">
        </li>
        
        <li>As you can see in these pictures the accelerometer is very noisy. This lead me to taking a FFT of the data to gather a good cutoff
        frequency would be for the data. The FFT taken is shown below:</li>
         <img src="images for website/lab2/Lab2_Roll_FFT.png" width="650" height="400" alt="Roll FFT">
        <li>I also took an FFT of what the output would look like if I banged on the table continously:</li>
        <img src="images for website/lab2/Lab2_Roll_FFT_Banging_on_Table.png" width="650" height="400" alt="Roll FFT with banging">
        <li>After taking the FFT I was able to see that a cutoff between 5-10hz should be sufficent in filtering out the higher frequncy noise. This lead to a low pass filter that'
        produced that was produced by these equations and produced this image even with noise induced into the data:</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Gyroscope</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compute pitch, roll, and yaw from gyroscope data.</li>
        <li>Compare filtered accelerometer and gyroscope results.</li>
        <li>Implement a complementary filter for stable angle estimation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Sample Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Optimize main loop execution speed.</li>
        <li>Store time-stamped IMU data efficiently.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate at least 5 seconds of IMU data transmission via Bluetooth.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Record a Stunt</h3>

    <p>To conclude this lab I was able to drive the small RC car before modifcations would be made internally with new hardware.
    When using the toy I noticed that at a certain speed the car would drift in one direction and that more complex
    movement was hard to pull off. It did take some adjusting before it felt that I had control the toy.
    Note: Since this video is a first person FOV I am using one hand to steer the toy so sorry for the bad control of the toy.</p>
