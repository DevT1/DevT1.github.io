      Lab 1: The Artemis board and Bluetooth
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Lab Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this lab was to familiarize myself with using Jupyter Lab as a way of
        having a virtual environment with Python, progamming the course's microcontroller Sparkfun's
        RedBoard Artemis Nano, and using Bluetooth to send commands and data back and form between the
        Artemis board and my laptop.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Material List
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Redboard Atremis Nano Board</li>
        <li>USB-A to USB-C cable</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>
        Lab 1A
    </h2>
    <p>
        For this section of the lab, I had to setup the connection between my laptop and the Arttemis board.
        After connecting the two with the USB cable I went into the arduino IDE selcted the correct board and port to be able to use
        the Arduino IDE to program the Artemis board. Following this I conducted 4 programs to verify different aspects of the board. These programs are as follows:
    </p>
    <h2>
        Blink
    </h2>
    <p>This example was a very simple blink program. This program would set the on board LED to be on for 1 second then turn it off for 1 second then repeat.</p>

    <h2>
        Serial Monitor
    </h2>
    <p>This example was done to verify that there is a steady serial connection between the Artemis Board and my laptop. As you can see in the picture below I 
        would type out different sentences and phrases and they would show up in the serial montior.</p>

    <h2>
        AnalogRead/Temperature Readings
    </h2>
    <p>This example was used to verify ADC usability and if the onboard temperature sensor is working. As you will see in the video the ambient temperature
    stayed around 3800 but when I applied heat through touching the sensor with my finger the ADC value would increase to 4500-4600 verifying that it works.</p>

    <h2>
        Microphone Output and PDM
    </h2>
    <p>This example was used to verify if the onboard microphone was working. As you will see in the video when I created sounds by either clapping or whislting 
        the highest detected frequency would increase or decrease depending on the noise being produced.

      Lab 1A Conclusion
    </h1>
    <p>
        After running each of these programs this portion of the lab leaves me in a good position to expand
        on the connection between my laptop and the Artemis board. The next portion of the lab will have a 
        heavy focus on sending data from my laptop to the Artemis board and vice versa.
